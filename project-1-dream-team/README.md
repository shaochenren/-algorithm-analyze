# Description
For project 1 is a demonstortion sorting algorithm in the following way.
# is_initialized()
  Return true when this disk_state is in alternating format. That means that the first disk at index 0 is dark, the second disk at index 1 is light, and so on for the entire row of disks. bool is_initialized() const {

# is_sorted()
  Return true when this disk_state is fully sorted, with all dark disks on the left (low indices) and all light disks on the right (high indices).
# sort_alternate()
Algorithm that sorts disks using the alternate algorithm.
# sort lawnmower
Algorithm that sorts disks using the lawnmower algorithm.
